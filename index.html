<p><h2>WELCOME</h2></p>
<p>Hi, there! Thanks for visiting my website. Let me take you on a short tour.
<br>
My name is Harsha. I am a freelancer and a consultant with considerable
<br>
programming experience in various technologies. I have worked on different 
<br>
stand-alone as well as web applications in my service. I spend most of my time
<br>
in exploring new technologies and writing small hacks to open source software.
</p>

<p>
Did you see the projects tab? Yes! you can download these source files
<br>
and use them absolutely for free of cost. I feel happy to share my work
<br>
and knowledge with all of you. Also, I'd pleased to take a look at your work and
<br>
will be more than happy to contribute a few code fragments in your project. 
<br>


</p>

<p>
I welcome all kinds of suggestions and contributions from fellow developers
<br>
regarding the set of valuable features that can be added to my software.
<br>
If interested, please leave me an email regarding your ideas and we can work
<br>
 together on a selected project.
</p>

<p>
Wait a second! I know what you're thinking. I'm not that computer sciency as
<br>
you think. I love to be social and try to engage myself in as many recreational
<br>
activities as possible. I do swimming and bowling on weekends and workout a lot on 
<br>
week days. Now and then, I watch movies and play racquetball too. I love to spend
<br>
time with nature and occassionally, I go out for long walks accompanied by 
<br>
pleasant classical Indian music. I love my family and friends and plan social
<br>
gatherings often. That's all about me! Please feel free to drop an appreciation
<br>
or a suggestion email and I'll get back to you with all due respect.

</p>

<p><h2><b>THANK YOU!</b></h2></p>
